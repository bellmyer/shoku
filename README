Shoku
=====

Shoku is (or will be) a set of tools if you're using Shoulda and Cucumber.

The first of these tools is a scaffold generator that creates the factory, shoulda
tests for the controller, and cucumber features.

...at the moment, it only has the shoulda and factory stuff.  Cucumber features
coming soon.
